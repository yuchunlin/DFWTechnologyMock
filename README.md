## Project Overview

This project is a mockup of a modernized website template for DFW Technology. It is heavily based on Start Bootstrap/Stylish Portfolio, the creator of which you can find in the creator section. All edits to the original template were made by myself. This project is a work in progress, mostly as a learning tool as I study HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap.
